        <![CDATA[It was released by Warner Bros. Records at the end of 1998. The album was executive produced by Rob Dickens. Upon its debut, critical reception was generally positive. Believe became Cher's most commercially-successful release, reached number one and Top 10 all over the world. In the United States, the album was released on November 10, 1998, and reached number four on the Billboard 200 chart, where it was certified four times platinum.
 
 The album featured a change in Cher's music; in addition, Believe presented a vocally stronger Cher and a massive use of vocoder and Auto-Tune. In 1999, the album received 3 Grammy Awards nominations for &quot;Record of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Pop Album&quot; and winning &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;. Throughout 1999 and into 2000 Cher was nominated and winning many awards for the album including a Billboard Music Award for &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot;, Lifelong Contribution Awards and a Star on the Walk of Fame shared with former Sonny Bono. The boost in Cher's popularity led to a very successful Do You Believe? Tour.
 
 The album was dedicated to Sonny Bono, Cher's former husband who died earlier that year from a skiing accident.
 
 Cher also recorded a cover version of &quot;Love Is in the Air&quot; during early sessions for this album. Although never officially released, the song has leaked on file sharing networks.
